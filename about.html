            <h1>About Me</h1>
        <section>I am currently a senior at Michigan State University studying games and interactive media. From this I have gained experience in 3d modeling using Blender and Plasticity, animation using Maya, and programming in C#, C++, Python, HTML, and CSS.
            <br>
            <br>
            When I finish my degree in the spring of 2024, I would like to find a position programming for a game design studio.
            <br>
            <br>
            Outside of school, I enjoy playing video games, working out, and riding my motorcycle.</section>
